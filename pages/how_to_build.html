              To prevent any accidents happening or components dying during the
              process, make sure to have enough space to lay out your
              components, preferably on a table. If you want to ground yourself
              to have an extra guarantee that you won't fry any component, you
              can connect your PSU to the wall (with its switch off) and touch
              the metal parts every once in a while. You'll also want any tool
              that may help you hold your screws, as well as any manuals you may
              need (specially Motherboard).

              With your motherboard on the table, find the CPU socket, lift the
              lever from it's lock, and pull it to take out the plastic cover.
              Note that with AMD's AM4 CPUs and earlier the pins are on the CPU
              so you need to be extra careful when placing it into the socket.
              Make sure you align the triangle on your CPU with the one on the
              socket, and carefully place it in. You won't need to apply any
              extra pressure since if you aligned the arrow, it will fit nicely.
              Check to see if it's correctly in place, drop the retaining
              bracket and pull the lever back into its lock. You may need to
              apply more force on the lever with newer 12th and 13th gen Intel
              CPUs.

              If you have 2 modules in a 4 slots motherboard, check the MOBO's
              manual to know on which modules it will perform best. It'll
              usually be the far most slot and second slot from your CPU. You
              always want to skip one slot when using 2 DIMMs for it to run on
              dual-channel, giving better performance. Lower the latches and
              align the notch on your DIMMs with small bump on the slots. It
              will not need much force, so if it's struggling to go in, make
              sure to check if the notch is aligned properly. Once the latches
              click, you know the DIMM is sloted correctly, and if they didn't
              go fully up, you can nudge them to their closed position.

              Some CPUs come with stock coolers, and if you're not planning on
              overclocking or stressing your processor too much they can be
              cheap option, though there are many other great options available
              if you're looking for more power or a quieter experience.
              Regardless of your choosing, they will have their own steps for
              the installation so make sure you check the manual! Remove the
              film on the bottom of the cooler, apply thermal paste to the top
              of the CPU and place the CPU cooler on top of the CPU, lining up
              the mounting holes on the cooler with the screws on the
              motherboard. Secure it to the motherboard using the screws
              provided with the cooler and don't forget to connect it to the 3
              or 4 pin fan header.

              If you're using an SSD or a HDD, attach the SATA cables to the
              storage devices and the motherboard, making sure to plug them into
              the appropriate SATA ports on the motherboard. SATA cables are
              typically labeled, so it should be easy to match them up with the
              correct ports. If it's an HDD you'll also need to connect a power
              cable from the power supply to the drive. Once your storage
              devices are connected, you can secure them in the appropriate
              drive bays in the case. Make sure the drives are securely fastened
              to prevent them from moving around during operation.

              If you're using an M.2 drive, you might not need any additional
              cables, as these drives typically connect directly to the
              motherboard. Locate the M.2 slot typically located near the CPU
              socket on the motherboard. It's a small slot with a connector at
              the end, and it might be labeled "M.2", "M", or "NVMe". If your
              M.2 slot has a cover, remove it by unscrewing the retaining screw
              and sliding the cover off. Insert the M.2 drive into the slot at a
              30-degree angle, making sure to align the notches on the drive
              with the corresponding notches in the slot. Push down gently on
              the drive until it clicks into place. Secure the drive with the
              screw and put the cover back on.

              Once your motherboard is assembled, it's time to install it into
              the case. But first, don't forget to place your I/O shield into
              the case, it's the metal cover for the ports, and it comes with
              your MOBO. Locate the standoffs (small metal screws) that came
              with your motherboard, and screw the standoffs into the case at
              the appropriate locations, according to the motherboard layout.
              Gently place the motherboard onto the standoffs, lining up the
              ports and connectors with the corresponding openings in the case.
              Secure the motherboard to the standoffs with screws, making sure
              not to overtighten.

              Typically, the PSU installation area is at the bottom of the case,
              though some cases might have it at the top or back. If your PSU is
              modular, connect all the cables needed before inserting it into
              the case. It should be installed with the fan facing whatever
              direction it can pull air from, up or down. Slide the PSU into the
              installation area and secure it to the case using the screws
              provided. Connect the 24-pin ATX cable to the motherboard's 24-pin
              power header, and the CPU power cable to the CPU power header on
              the motherboard. If your graphics card needs more power connect
              the PCIe cables to the graphics card's power connectors and
              connect any SATA cables to the power supply as well.Make sure to
              consult your motherboard and graphics card manuals to determine
              the correct headers and connectors.

              Locate the PCIe slot on the motherboard that corresponds to your
              graphics card (usually the top one), and remove any covers or
              brackets from the back of the case that might be blocking the way.
              Gently insert the graphics card into the slot, making sure to push

              you may need to install a Wi-Fi card to connect to a wireless
              network. When installing a PCIe card, carefully insert the card
              into an available PCIe slot on the motherboard (usually the one
              below the GPU's slot), aligning the notches on the card with the
              notches in the slot. Press down firmly until the card clicks into
              place. If you're installing a USB adapter, simply plug it into an
              available USB port on the PC.

              If you're installing case fans, you'll need to connect them to the
              appropriate fan headers on the motherboard or a fan controller (if
              your case has one). Fans typically have a 3- or 4-pin connector,
              which should match the header on the motherboard or controller.
              Some fans might also have an RGB (or ARGB) connector, which can be
              used to control the fan's lighting effects. Also attach all the
              USB type conectors and the front-panel cables to their respective
              headers. Consult the fan and motherboard manuals to determine
              which headers to use and how to connect them. You may finally turn
              on your PC to test that it's working before you do any cable
              management. Remember to connect your HDMI cable to your GPU if you
              have one!

              You'll need to download the operating system (OS) installation
              files from the manufacturer's website and create a bootable USB
              drive. This process may differ depending on the OS you are
              installing. Plug the drive onto the back of the PC and turn it on,
              it should boot into the OS installer. If your system doesn't
              access your NVMe drive, while the PC is turning on, open the BIOS
              with F12, DEL or the specified key your MOBO's manufacturer
              specifies and look for an option related to M.2 or NVMe, and make
              sure it's set to "Enabled". Save your changes and exit the BIOS,
              and your M.2 drive should now be recognized by the system. This
              may vary depending on the manufacturer. Once installed, don't
              forget to also check for any updates, and go to your
              manufacturers' websites to update any drivers. Congratulations!
              You're done.
