              The Central Processing Unit is the brain of the computer, and the
              one who processes everything. So one of the main things you want
              to focus to get a fast PC is finding a "high" core count and
              frequency one. The higher the amount of cores, the more tasks it
              can handle at a time, and the higher the frequency, the faster it
              can handle those tasks. Note that while building a PC, higher/more
              expensive does not always mean better, so find one that suits your
              needs.

              The Motherboard is the main PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and it's
              the responsible of making the connection between every component
              on the PC. They all have lots of features and differences between
              each other but one of the main things you will need to check
              before buying is the socket it supports. That way, you'll know if
              it's compatible with your CPU since they also support various
              sockets, mostly per generation that comes out.

              The Random-access Memory (not to be confused with the storage) is
              a form of memory that will read and write any data needed by the
              CPU at any given time. It does this in an instant, but it will
              also not retain the data once the PC is turned off. They come in
              capacities ranging from 2gb all the way up to 64gb per module, and
              they go into the RAM slots of the motherboard so it depends on how
              many yours has. If you're going to use more than 1 module (always
              recommended), try to always pair them by the same capacity and
              model.

              The one everyone talks about, the Graphics Card! It's main task is
              to process any visuals or "graphics" and outputs them into your
              display, in this case, a monitor. So, if you want to play the
              newest most graphically intense games, or work in a field that
              requires heavy renders, video editing, graphics design, you should
              opt for getting a more powerful one. As said before, pricier
              doesn't always mean better so get what suits your needs, that wat

              Storage comes in different types, but the 3 main ones are: HDD
              (Hard Drive), SSD (Solid State Drive) and NVMe SSD (Non-Volatile
              Memory Express SSD). Although their names sound complicated, the
              main variation is in speed, going from slowest to fastest
              respectively. It's highly recommended to use NVMe SSDs nowadays
              since the prices aren't much higher and they offer way faster read
              and write speeds, making your operating system experience and file
              management a lot more enjoyable, but remember that your MOBO
              should have M.2 slots available.

              Power Supply Units are what give energy to our PC and with all the
              specifications they have, it can be daunting to choose one, but
              it's usually recommended to buy one that has a higher wattage that
              what your PC will need, mainly for upgradeability and your
              components actually getting the power needed to function, and
              secondly that you buy one from a reputable brand like Corsair,
              Seasonic, beQuiet!. There's always the extra of buying one with
              higher efficiency (bronze, silver, gold, platinum).

              CPU coolers are as needed as any other component in the list since
              it generates lots of heat and that means less performance. The
              main thing is that you need to get one that's compatible with your
              CPU and MOBO's socket. There are also 2 main types of coolers, the
              Tower Coolers, and the AIO Waterloop Coolers (All-in-one) . The
              latter are better at cooling but they also have drawbacks like
              being more noisy, precier, and take up more space. As always, the
              more beefy the component, the more cooling it needs!

              What is a PC without a cool way to display it? Not only that but
              cases also protect your components from excessive dust, and any
              other possible harm that could come from having them laying
              around. They have spaces for cable management, and fans that allow
              your PC to have even better cooling. They also serve as a way to
              customize the looks of your build a bit more by choosing its
              color, size (depending on the form factor - ATX, Micro ATX, Mini
              ATX), and if you want a side panel to look into it!

              You will probably come accross some more things that you'll need
              while building your rig like Thermal Paste, which is always needed
              for your CPU to transfer the heat correctly to its cooler! Be sure
              to also have a good voltage regulator since you may not want your
              PC die after a power outage. You may also need a Wi-Fi card if
              your MOBO doesn't come with one already. It's always good to have
              a few screwdrivers in hand too. And of course, don't forget the
              monitor, keyboard, mouse and a flash-drive with the operating
